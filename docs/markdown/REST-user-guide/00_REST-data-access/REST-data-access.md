Structr comes with a powerful REST backend that automatically creates REST resources for each known type. You can use these resources to manage your data, and even do complex queries on it, i.e. exact / inexact search, range expressions, etc. Data validation happens on the server-side as well, and the server will return the HTTP status code **422** Unprocessable Entity together with a meaningful JSON error message that you can parse in your application if a validation error occurs.

The following sections illustrate the basic use of the Structr REST backend with `curl`. We will access an empty REST resource, create a new entity, modify it, and eventually delete it. We assume that you have a Structr server running on your local machine with the default port and REST path, which is `8082` and `/structr/rest`.
