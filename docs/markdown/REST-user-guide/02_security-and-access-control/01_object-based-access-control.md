The object-based access is based on an ACL concept with three different access levels:

    "visibleToPublicUsers" : true

Visible to public users:Everyone can [read/write/delete/set access rights for] the object

    "visibleToAuthenticatedUsers" : true

Visible to authenticated users: Logged-in users can [read/write/delete/set access rights for] the object

Individual rights for a user/group: User/Group can [read/write/delete/set access rights for] the object

Private: Only the owner can [read/write/delete/set access rights for] the object

Default is 'private'.
