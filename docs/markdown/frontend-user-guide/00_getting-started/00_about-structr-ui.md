Structr's main backend user interface (Structr UI) is a tool to support web developers to create graph-based mobile and web applications.

<p class="info">Structr UI is not yet a fully-fledged Content Management System (CMS) with typical authoring, editing and publishing workflows, even though the basis for this kind of functionality is already there.
Structr is a highly malleable open-source product, and we as the community behind Structr need your feedback on which features you like to see in the next versions. Our goal is not less than creating the CMS of the future - based on a graph database, open, modular and fast.</p>
