In the main area in the center of the Pages view you see a preview of the currently selected page. The preview area is empty until at least one page was created.

The preview is not just a passive page. Each DOM element is highlighted by a light shadow border and can be clicked to select it. When you click multiple times on the same element, the parent nodes expand in the Pages Tree view, from top to bottom.

Each content node can be edited inline. You can activate the inline editing mode by double-clicking on a text.
