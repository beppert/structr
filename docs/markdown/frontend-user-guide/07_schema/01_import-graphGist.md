You can import a GraphGist to initially load data into Structr and let Structr read and analyze the data model from the GraphGist code to create an initial schema in Structr. To import a GraphGist, copy its raw URL and paste it into the designated form field.
The raw URL is what's in your browser's URL field when you see the AsciiDoc source code in the browser's main area.
