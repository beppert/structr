Structr can host files of any type. You can upload files through the UI via drag & drop, or connecting via FTP.

Files are stored as binary objects in the file system, referenced by its UUID in Structr's underlying graph database.

To link a &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt; or &lt;img&gt; element in a page to a file, choose the file in the file selector (click on the link icon), and set the src or href attribute to ${link.path}.
