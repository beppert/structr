The Folder Area contains all folder elements in Structr as a pageable object list. A folder is a container for other folders, files or images. You can put a folder into another by drag and drop, creating a folder hiearchy or folder tree.

If you have a large number of folders, you can step through the pages using the Paging Control.

Folders can also be accessed, created, renamed and deleted through FTP.
