Structr provides built-in management of users and groups. Creating users and groups is as simple as clicking on the respective buttons and renaming the new object by clicking on the name and hit enter or tab after chaging it.

To allow a user to login, you need to set a password.

A user can be added to a group by dragging the user element and dropping it onto the desired group.
